<h2>Rory Gallagher, Irish Legend</h2>
<hr>
        <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Gallagher" target="_blank">Rory Gallagher</a>, the legendary blues guitarist who died in 1995 at the tragically young age of 47, was probably one of the most gifted guitarists in rock history. A new book, <span class="yellowText">Rory Gallagher</span>: His Life and Times by Marcus Connaughton, tells the story of <span class="yellowText">Rory's</span> rise, from humble beginnings in Cork City where he bought his legendary Fender Stratocaster guitar as a fifteen year old in 1963, to eventually selling 30 million albums worldwide.
        </p>

        Marcus Connaughton, is a veteran of the Irish record industry and a blues expert. Featuring exclusive interviews with many of <span class="yellowText">Rory's</span> contemporaries, including the multi-award-winning filmmaker Tony Palmer, <span class="yellowText">Rory Gallagher's</span> Taste band mate John Wilson and U2’s world-renowned sound engineer Joe O’Herlihy, <span class="yellowText">Rory Gallagher</span>: His Life and Times provides a personal insight into the life and music of one of the greatest guitarists the world has seen.

        For those of you who weren’t around during the 1970’s or who aren’t familiar with <span class="yellowText">Rory Gallagher</span>, I asked Marcus to describe the man and his music. He explained: “<span class="yellowText">Rory</span> although born in Ballyshannon in County Donegal, grew up and was educated in the heart of Cork City. He pursued his passion for music as soon as he heard the sound of Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, Lonnie Donegan and Elvis Presley on the valve radio, and later listening to American Forces Network where he heard Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly and Muddy Waters. He was a self-taught musician and mastered the acoustic guitar in his early teens progressing to his renowned (1961) Fender Stratocaster Guitar – a Sunburst Model purchased (2nd hand) at the age of fifteen from Crowleys Music Store in Cork in 1963 for one hundred pounds.

        ‘During his career <span class="yellowText">Rory</span> sold over 30 million albums worldwide and has a major following in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Holland. The interest in his output has grown since his untimely death in June 1995 with tribute shows in Spain, USA, Sweden, Scotland, Holland, Wiesbaden in Germany, Cork and the Annual Tribute Festival in Ballyshannon, Co Donegal.”

        The book is a very personal book, and I wondered what drew Marcus to <span class="yellowText">Rory Gallagher</span>? He told me, “I saw <span class="yellowText">Rory</span> with Taste in the National Boxing Stadium in 1968/9 – the energy, dynamism and sheer power of the performance were electrifying. I wanted to chart the career and progress of our first ever major rock star who – He was a major guitar hero in Europe in the sixties following performances in Hamburg and in London’s Marquee Club. He was dedicated to his craft as both a composer and musician and he felt he never in his career – spanning three decades – sold out to commercial pressures.”
